With a single canvas print, all you need is a simple nail/screw and hammer! All of our canvases come standard with a preinstalled sawtooth hanging kit, so you don’t need any extra hardware. Simply hold up your canvas against the wall, and have a friend or family member take a look to ensure that your chosen spot looks good. Then simply insert a small screw or nail into the wall, and gently hang your canvas upon it! With split canvas wall art like canvas wall displays or triptychs. The process can be a bit more involved. But not to worry, it’s much easier than it seems! We recommend clearing some space on the floor and arranging your canvas prints on the floor. Here you can get an idea of the spacing you want between each frame. We recommend 1-3 inches between canvases, leaning towards more space the larger your canvases are. For a wall display, you should start by hanging the center-most canvas on your wall first! Then, you can work outwards by hanging the canvas around it. Make sure to take a step back between each canvas and ensure that they’re nice and level! Soon enough, you’ll be done!

<p><b>FAQ - How To Hang Canvas Wall Art</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanging canvas wall art can sometimes feel like somewhat of a daunting task. With just a little bit of preparation, and maybe some help from a friend or family member, hanging your new canvas wall art can be a breeze! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a single canvas print, all you need is a simple nail/screw and hammer! All of our canvases come standard with a preinstalled sawtooth hanging kit, so you don’t need any extra hardware. Simply hold up your canvas against the wall, and have a friend or family member take a look to ensure that your chosen spot looks good. Then simply insert a small screw or nail into the wall, and gently hang your canvas upon it! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With split canvas wall art like <a href="https://canvasprints.com/pages/canvas-prints-wall-displays">canvas wall displays</a> or <a href="https://canvasprints.com/pages/triptych-wall-art">triptychs</a>. The process can be a bit more involved. But not to worry, it’s much easier than it seems! We recommend clearing some space on the floor and arranging your canvas prints on the floor. Here you can get an idea of the spacing you want between each frame. We recommend 1-3 inches between canvases, leaning towards more space the larger your canvases are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a wall display, you should start by hanging the center-most canvas on your wall first! Then, you can work outwards by hanging the canvas around it. Make sure to take a step back between each canvas and ensure that they’re nice and level! Soon enough, you’ll be done! Don’t forget to take a photo of your newly hung canvas and send it to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">info@canvasprints.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to get a free $10 gift card to create even more canvases!</span></p>
